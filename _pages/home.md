The [Hierarchical Data Modeling Framework (HDMF)](https://github.com/hdmf-dev/hdmf)
supports the specification of hierarchical data standards and creation of advanced
data APIs that insulate the users from the specification and I/O, enabling the integration
of new data backends and flexible extension of standards.HDMF is also available
via [PyPI](https://pypi.org/project/hdmf/) and [Conda](https://anaconda.org/conda-forge/hdmf).

The <a href="{{ site.url }}{{ site.baseurl }}/hdmf-common-docs">HDMF Common Schema</a>,
provides specifications of common reusable data structures (e.g., dynamic tables) that
facilitate the design of advanced, modern data standards, e.g., [NWB](https://www.nwb.org/).
The hdmf-common-schema is included with the main HDMF software so that no separate installation is required.

The [HDMF Documentation Utilities](https://github.com/hdmf-dev/hdmf-docutils)  then provide
utilities for creating user documentation for format specifications developed using HDMFs
specification language. The hdmf-docutils are also available on
[PyPI](https://pypi.org/project/hdmf-docutils/).
