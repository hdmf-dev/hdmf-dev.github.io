The Hierarchical Data Modeling Framework (HDMF) supports the specification of
hierarchical data standards and creation of advanced data APIs that insulate
the users from the specification and I/O, enabling the integration of new
data backends and flexible extension of standards. HDMF is available online at
[https://github.com/hdmf-dev/hdmf](https://github.com/hdmf-dev/hdmf).
